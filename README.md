## Final Design

## Introduction
My site is a music trivia quiz. The aim of this project was to create an interactive front-end site which responds to user actions. 

## User Expierence (UX)
- ### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to test my knowledge on music trivia.
- The user can test their knowledge by playing the quiz. 
2. As a user, I want to enter my unique username and have the game acknowledge it. 
- The user can enter their username by typing in the input-type(text) field. The game will welcome them and call them by their username. 
3. As a user, I want the screen to be responsive across all of my devices. 
- The game can be played across a reange of devices as it's fully responsive. 
4. As a user, I want to have answer options to choose from. 
- The game has two options - true & false. 
5. As a user, i want a wide array of questions to answer. 
- There are 20 questions to answer. 
6. As a user, I want to see my final score. 
- The users final score is displayed once all questions are answered. 
7. As a user, I want to be able to restart the quiz if needed. 
- There is a reset button which will reset the user score and randomly shuffle the questions again. 

- ### Design 
    - ### Colour Scheme 
    I used a olive to yellow gradient colour as I believe the colours go well together and do not cause any contrast errors. 
    1. Black was used for main text.  
    4. Black was used for hover background and olive was used for hover text, this allowed the user to confirm that they were hovering over the buttons. 
 

    - ### Fonts
    For the fonts, I used 'Boogaloo' for headings & 'Abel' for regular text, both from Google Fonts. I used 'sans-serif' as a backup should those fonts not be available for all.

    - ### Icons 
    The icon used in the start button was obtained from Font Awesome. 

    - ### Images
    The logo image was made on Canva Pro by myself - image source in reference section. 

### Wireframes
I used wireframes to give myself a general idea of what I wanted the site to look like.
